# pilot-001 p13 家门口图像执行包 / The Home Doorway Image Execution Package

> Workflow E draft only. This is not a compiled prompt, WebGPTImage handoff, GenerationRun, ReferenceAsset, final package, or image output.

## Package Summary / 执行包概要

- Project: `pilot-001`
- Page: `p13`
- Scene: [scene-home-doorway](../40-scenes/scene-home-doorway.md)
- Characters: [char-xiaohe](../30-characters/char-xiaohe.md), [char-mama](../30-characters/char-mama.md)
- VisualStyle: [vs-pilot-001-warm-safe-night-picturebook](../50-visual-styles/vs-pilot-001-warm-safe-night-picturebook.md)
- PromptRecipe: [pr-pilot-001-safe-night-picturebook](../60-prompts/pr-pilot-001-safe-night-picturebook.md)
- Recipe hash: `6020fc5e5c83e043`

## Target Asset / 目标资产

Draft plan for the p13 page illustration: safe arrival home and the positive safety lesson. No image asset is created by this card.

## Dependency Graph / 依赖图

- Required canonical cards: StoryProject `pilot-001`, Scene `scene-home-doorway`, Character cards `char-xiaohe` and `char-mama`, VisualStyle `vs-pilot-001-warm-safe-night-picturebook`, PromptRecipe `pr-pilot-001-safe-night-picturebook`.
- Required ReferenceAsset cards: none currently available or created.
- Blocking state: human review required before `ready`; F/G and image generation blocked.

## Allowed Content / 允许内容

- Warm home doorway, lit windows, welcome mat, and safe glow spilling onto the path.
- Xiao He and Mama stepping into safety; coats may be coming off at the threshold.
- Ambient family warmth only as background, non-carded figures.
- Positive safety lesson mood: stay together and ask for help.

## Forbidden Content / 禁止内容

- No horror, realistic thriller, jump scares, monsters, ghost faces, gore, blood, crime, weapons, adult or sexualized content.
- No religious punishment, occult symbols, magic, possession, curses, or supernatural payoff.
- No scolding, shame, punishment, unsafe family dynamics, or adult subplot.
- No source names, source places, source wording, copied sequence packaging, channel identity, or identifiable horror motifs.
- No printed narration, final prompt text, image IDs, or WebGPTImage handoff text in the source illustration.

## Prompt Recipe Binding / Prompt 技法绑定

Bound to `pr-pilot-001-safe-night-picturebook` with verified `recipe_hash: 6020fc5e5c83e043`. This package only binds the recipe; it does not compile a prompt.

## Reference Asset Binding / 参考资产绑定

`reference_assets`, `required_reference_assets`, and `prohibited_reference_assets` are empty because no accepted ReferenceAsset cards exist for `pilot-001`. Future anchors must be accepted and explicitly bound before this package can become `ready`.

## Canvas and Output Rules / 画布与输出规则

- Draft aspect ratio: `1:1`.
- Output target: page illustration plan only.
- No generated image file, no raw output, and no accepted asset are created here.

## Generation Order / 生成顺序

Initial full-story order: 13 of 14. This order is planning metadata only and does not authorize generation.

## Manual Execution Instructions / 人工执行说明

No WebGPTImage execution is authorized from this draft. A later Workflow G handoff may be written only after this package becomes `ready` through Workflow E human review and Workflow F compile/lint.

## QA Acceptance Criteria / QA 验收标准

Later QA must confirm a cozy, reassuring resolution, no fear residue, and no extra uncarded main characters.

## Repair Triggers / 修复触发条件

Repair if the home scene feels unsafe, punitive, adult-focused, or introduces source-like identifiers.

## Result Backfill Procedure / 结果回填流程

No backfill now. If a later run is approved, GenerationRun and ReferenceAsset records must be created only through the relevant downstream workflows.

## R00 Anchor Dependency Policy / R00 锚图依赖策略

No R00, R01, or R02 dependency exists. The package must not imply a global style anchor or create reference assets.
